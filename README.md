# raspberry-bi
python and raspberry pi course, there are 3 exercises and the final project we did.

exercise 1: I've built a simple locker that has a built-in 4-digit code, when the code is entered incorrectly we turn on the led for 3 seconds,
            but if the code is entered 3 times incorrectly the system is locked and no code can be entered for 10 seconds. 
            
exercise 2: I've built an alarm clock, when turned on you can enter the actual time, and using two buttons you can set the alarm time.
            When the alarm is set on the LED will blink for 1 minute.
            
exercise 3: I've used an ADC model and a potentiometer (to control voltage) for every increase of 0.5 volts the frequency of the blinking LED changes by 
            1HZ. When the input volt is higher than 2.3V I print " OVER RANGE" on the LCD.
            
final exercise: for the final exercise I used both an ADC and a DAC to build a simple processor that does the following instructions:
                  1. adding 
                  2. subtracting 
                  3. multiplying
                  4. division
                  5. modulo
                  6. power 
                  7. floor division
                  8. comparator. 
the inputs and the instruction are all controlled by volts ( an ADC and a potentiometer), while the output result voltage is shown on a voltmeter (through a DAC).
